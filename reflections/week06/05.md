# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.
vue seems like a useful and relatively easy-ish editor to use. But there is a lot to it and I feel like I am having a hard time committing everything I've seen and learned this far to memory. 

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
the blogger project went well. 
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
how we are essentially replacing the mvc format with vue
- What are you struggling with?
remembering it all. sometimes connecting it all as well. 
- What would you count as a victory?
I didnt get as much done on my checkpoint as I would have liked. But I thoroughly understood the parts of it that I did get completed.
